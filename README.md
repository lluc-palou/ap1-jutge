# ap1-jutge

<p align="justify">This repository contains codes sent to https://jutge.org/ in order to solve the problems proposed by the teachers of API (Algorithmic and Programming I, 2022-2023).</p>

<p align="justify">Additionally, attached to this repository you can find the lessons provided to the students, including:</p>

- <p align="justify">Programming theory and support slides for the current mainstream programming languages, Python and C++.</p>
- <p align="justify">Example codes shown in class.</p>
- <p align="justify">Several repositories used to solve the proposed problems and even more from other courses.</p>


## Schedule of classes and programming theory lessons

<p align="justify">Here you can find the schedule of classes followed by the teachers of API (Algorithmic and Programming I, 2022-2023) related to programming theory (Python and C++), with special focus on data structures. In addition, there are presentation slides elaborated to support the coding theory that involve the matter taught in this subject.</p>

## Class codes

<p align="justify">Here you can find the codes proposed in class that are used to show the theory implementation, moreover, they illustrate how basic data structures are defined, initialized and used to solve simple problems that later on can be pieces of a large puzzle.</p>

## Complementary repositories

<p align="justify">Here you can find attached other repositories of students from several degrees in which the proposed programming problems were the same or different. The solution that they gave can be approximately the same as the stated in this repository, or can be more accurate, or efficient, in therms that they used other programming technics and data structures to face the mentioned problems.</p>

## Disclaimer

<p align="justify">The goal that intends to achieve this repository is merely educative, in the sense that is designed to be a hub in which programmers may turn to if they need any of the knowledge contained in. In order to advise you against sending this codes directly to jutge platform, proposed solutions to the problems may not be accepted by the jutge by two reasons:</p>

- <p align="justify">On the one hand, the problems may not be sufficient well considered, or the given solution may be incomplete.</p>
- <p align="justify">On the other hand, jutge platform is continuously updating its problems and checking the corresponding solutions.</p>

<p align="justify">In fact, this repository enhances that codes can be a helpful tool to show you techniques that allow you to perform better in programming, although through programming is the best way to learn.</p>

<p align="justify">Finally, concerning code stated in the repository, its variables, functions, docstrings and comments are written in English, but you can find occasionally annotations in Catalan.</p>
